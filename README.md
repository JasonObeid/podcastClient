<a href="https://jasonobeid.github.io/podcaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podcaster</a> was built as a purely client-side application so that it could be fully hosted on GitHub pages.

I created it as an opportunity to learn and test out TypeScript, React-Query, and Vite.

Front-end Tech:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- React-Router
- React-Query
- Material UI
- [PodcastIndexJS](https://github.com/JasonObeid/PodcastIndexJS) (A library I created to interact with the Podcast Index)

External APIs:
- [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) (Free and open index of categorized podcast)
- Cloudinary (For dynamic image resizing)
- Firebase (For database + authentication)

Development & Build Tools:
- Vite
- ESLint
- Prettier
